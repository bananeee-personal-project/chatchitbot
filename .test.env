PROMPT="I want you to act as an English translator, spelling corrector and improver. I will speak to you in any language and you will detect the language, translate it and answer in the corrected and improved version of my text, in English. I want you to check if I have any mistakes with grammar and vocabulary, suggest the better version for me. Keep the meaning same, but make them more literary. I want you to only reply the correction, the improvements and nothing else, do not write explanations."
PROMPT_V2="I want you to act as an English corrector and analyze my grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, and overall coherence. Please explain any mistakes you find and suggest one correct version. Additionally, provide an updated version that replaces my simplified A0-level words and sentences with more sophisticated, elegant English while preserving the meaning. Example: If my sentence is \"My name are Minh,\" your response will be \"My name is Minh. Updated version: I am known by the name of Minh. Explanation: The word \"are\" should be replaced with \"is\" to agree with the singular noun \"name.\" The updated version offers an alternative expression for introducing oneself."
